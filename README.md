# Materials for the Summer School "Advancing Theoretical Astrophysics"

This repository contains the materials (lecture notes, slides, exercises, etc.) for the summer school "Advancing Theoretical Astrophysics, held July 14-26 2019 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

The repository is organized by days. You can find the schedule on the [ATA website repository](https://github.com/collectiveastronomy/advancingtheoastro/blob/master/ATABlockSchedule.pdf) as well as short descriptions of each unit [in the longer schedule](https://github.com/collectiveastronomy/advancingtheoastro/blob/master/ata_curriculum.pdf).
