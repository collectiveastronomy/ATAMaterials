    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will explore the nature of inverse Compton scattering. Inverse Compton scattering is crucial to understanding the high-energy spectra of astrophysical sources like accretion disks. Consider the spectrum of the famout X-ray binary Cygnus X-1, a black hole accreting mass from it's O-star companion from <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999MNRAS.309..496G/abstract\">Gierlinski et al. 1999</a><a id=\"Fig1\"></a>:\n",
    "\n",
    "![cygx-1](http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~heinzs/files/gierlinski.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this so-called soft state, the majority of the emission at energies above 2 keV is due to that spectral component labeled \"continuum\" in the figure. This \"continuum\" is produced by a layer of hot gas hovering above the accretion disk in this system, like the solar corona sits above the Sun's photosphere. The electrons in this corona of hot, ionized gas Compton-upscatters the disk photons (in the figure above, the disk produces the long-dashed component at lower energies). Our goal here is to investigate just that process works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going through this tutorial will require some physics concepts and some programming and statistics concepts. The physic we need is\n",
    "1. free electron scattering of photons in the the electron's rest frame, which we will approximate as Thomson scattering, with a basic understanding of radiative transfer\n",
    "2. Lorentz transforms from the observer's frame to the electron's frame and back, which itself requires a bit of relativity: The definition and nature of four-vector (in particular: four-momenta and four-velocities). The basics are outlined in <a href=\"#Lorentz\">the next section</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The programming and statistics concept needed is the application of Monte Carlo techniques. Monte Carlo simulations solve equations statistically by simulating a large number of individual particle trajectories and events (in this case we are following photon trajectories), each called a trial. In terms of programming, this requires the use of a random number generator and then keeping track of the observables we are interested in. In terms of statistics, the particles are injected one by one with properties drawn from the probability distribution of the particles (for example, the energies of a thermal distribution of particles would be drawn from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the real work in creating a Monte Carlo simulation is in formulating the probability density function (PDF, also calle the distribution function in statistical mechanics) for our particles. As you will see, we will need to integrate the PDF to derive the __cumulative__ probability density function and then __invert__ it. Sometimes this is easy (as in the simplified example of this tutorial we are going through in class), sometimes this is hard (like in the case of the optional homework project on implementing a Planck function for the proper input distribution function of photons).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ There is a lot of commentary here, but not that much actual code. The raw code is liste in <a href=\"#appendix2\">Appendix 2</a> so you can see the basic structure.\n",

    "## 1.1 Problem Setup<a id=\"setup\"></a> <a href=\"#TOC\">(Back to TOC)</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an ionized, hot slab of gas (the corona) of temperature $T_{\\rm corona}$ with some finite thickness $L$, located above an optically thick source of blackbody photons (the disk) with temperature $T_{\\rm BB} \\ll T_{\\rm corona}$. The slab contains free electrons at density $n$ that can scatter the radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~heinzs/files/icmc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the sketch, set up your coordinate system with the corona above the disk in the $z$-direction and measure angles from the $z$-axis as $\\mu =\\cos{(\\theta)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Photons enter the slab from below with an isotropic distribution of angles $0 < \\mu \\leq 1$ and can exit the corona at the top surface. Downgoing photons are re-absorbed by the disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will store the basic Monte-Carlo simulation parameters in a dictionary called `mc_parms`, which will contain\n",
    "* `'N_photons'`: The number of photons we want our Monte-Carlo simulation to track\n",

    "## 1.2 Caveats and Simplifying Assumptions (Otherwise Known as Terms & Conditions)<a id=\"caveats\"></a> <a href=\"#TOC\">(Back to TOC)</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will make the simplifying assumption that the disk and corona are extended to infinity in the $x$ and $y$-directions so that our problem is symmetric about the $z$-axis. We measure optical depth as $d\\tau=n\\sigma_{\\rm T}ds$ along the photon trajectory.\n",
    "* We will neglect the non-linear effects of Compton cooling on the temperature of the corona or heating of the disk (that is, assume that both maintain a fixed temperature).\n",
    "* We will neglect the Compton scattering recoil and treat scattering as elastic (that is, it doesn't change the energy of the photon).\n",
    "* We will neglect the relativistic (Klein-Nichina) corrections to the scattering cross section of high-energy photons. This is OK to lowest order, but will be important once the photons reach energies comparable to the electron rest mass _energy in the electron frame_.\n",
    "* We will initially simplify to mono-energetic seed photons and coronal electrons, but will fix that later.\n",
    "* We are also going to a simple, brute-force approach to Monte-Carlo. There are ways to be much more clever about how to generate trials so that the signal-to-noise of our simulation becomes more even. But that is for another day. \n",

The key parameter to consider here is the covering fraction, that is, what fraction of the disk surface is covered with corona patches.
